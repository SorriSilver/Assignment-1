# Welcome to my Assignment 1 readme 
hello the following is a descriptive file of the changes that have been made to the webpage 


# Readme
 1.I used semantic tags to replace and remove redundant classes on elements that did not need them
 2. I replaced the hero div with an actual `<img>` tag and used object-fit:cover to match the same style that existed before
 3. I then went through and added alt tags to all the images on the page for accessability 
 4. i then consolidated and updated the css rules to only require 1 selector for each rule set.
